Steps for Text Processing
text = "That movie was very boring, I watched it yesterday"

1. Tokenization
   - ["that", "movie", "was", "very", "boring", "," ,"i", "watched", "it", "yesterday"]

2. Remove Stopwords and Punctuations
   punctuations - !@#$%^&*()_}{[]|:";'<>?
   stopwords - that, was, i, it, is, am, are, this, what...   
   - ["movie", "very", "boring", "watched", "yesterday"]

3. Stemming / Lemmatization
   - play - played / playing 
   - fly  - flying
   - bought - buy
   ["movie", "very", "bore", "watch", "yesterday"]

4. Vectorization - Bag of words
  - CountVectorization
  - TF-IDF - Term Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency

- Naive Bayes
